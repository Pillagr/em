<h2>A Personal Website</h2>

This is a personal website I cloned from https://github.com/jules23/perso. 
I've since added several features including a personal store. 

<h3>Personal Use</h3>
If you'd like to make your own personal site with just the main page, I'd 
suggest cloning jules23/perso. Alternatively, remove all the store files,
and remove the <code>app.get(...)</code> functions from index.js for all undesired pages

<h3>Goals</h3>
I plan to set up a BTCPayServer instance to serve the store on this site. 
If you would like to sell goods or services on this site, please open an 
Issue on GitHub or email me.
